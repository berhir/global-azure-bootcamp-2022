He will create a scalable solution on stage with you in the first row. Get to know the best practices and see how your next big frontend project can evolve without boundaries.",

For this we use a normal webcam, many processes and libraries and of course Azure Tools and Azure Machine Learning. The signs have to be shown, processed and normalized in order to train an ML model with them. Furthermore, the recognition must be able to distinguish between individual signs in order to then recognize individual signs. Since sign language does not contain complete sentences, a sentence must be formed from the individual words with AI. We had to find out and solve all these challenges in a research project. In this session we will show our current state of research and how the implementation with cloud computing in Microsoft Azure can work.",

      "description": "Neither GitOps (with tools such as ArgoCD or Flux) nor K8s provides a standard in tracing, orchestrating and troubleshooting the lifecycle of complex application deployments. There is no standard to define what \"an application\" is and there is no standard for lifecycle hooks that would enable easy pre-deployment dependency checks or post deployment health checks on application level.\r\nThe CNCF project Keptn addresses those challenges by extending the Kubernetes Pod scheduler to provide OpenTelemetry Traces and Prometheus metrics for end-2-end deployment observability. Keptn introduces automated application-aware pre- and post-deployment lifecycle hooks to enforce dependency checks, send notifications or evaluates SLOs that otherwise need a custom K8s operator. As a side benefit you get automatic DORA metrics to measure the success of your DevOps automation.\r\nJoin this talk and learn how the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit (KLT) Operator extends observability into GitOps deployments and how it enables declarative deployment lifecycle orchestration!",

      "description": "Software development has changed a lot over time, becoming more complex by the day with a myriad of frameworks and tools to pick, globally distributed applications and the need for speed and reliability. This complexity makes troubleshooting issues in modern, cloud-native environments a real challenge. The common approach of: “let’s add a few log lines here and there and wait for the problem to happen again” does not scale.\r\n\r\nWhile logs are a widespread and powerful tool for troubleshooting, they often lack context and only show part of the problem. Observability and OpenTelemetry are all about providing this missing context. They help you understand and confidently answer questions about the state of your applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore the relationship between Observability and OpenTelemetry and how they can be leveraged in your .NET applications to align with modern observability practices\r\n",
