## Call for Participation

We are currently preparing the session content for Global Azure Austria 2022.

Global Azure is from the community, for the community. This is where you come in, dear speakers. GAA would not be possible without your great content and dedication.

This year's motto is **Practical Cloud Computing**. Therefore, we are particularly looking for sessions about how you use cloud computing in general and Microsoft Azure in particular for solving real-world project challenges.

### Topics

Here are some example topics, but don't feel limited by them. If you have other great content ideas, tell us about them.

* Automate the cloud with Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
* Use of Container-technology and Kubernetes in practice
* IoT projects with cloud backends
* Building APIs in the cloud
* Challenges and solutions in the area of cloud security
* Organizational transformation on the way into the cloud
* Your organization's cloud strategies in general
* Real-world DevOps
* Cloud-based data warehousing, data science, and machine learning

GAA is typically visited by a diverse set of people (e.g. professional developers, infrastructure specialists, data scientists, students, hobbyists, etc.). Therefore, we are looking for a broad range of session topics ranging from beginner content to technical deep dives.

If you are a first-time speaker and you want some mentoring from somebody who has given lots of sessions at conferences, [contact us](mailto:info@linz.coderdojo.net). Such mentoring can definitely be arranged and we would love you to give your first conference speech at GAA 2022.
