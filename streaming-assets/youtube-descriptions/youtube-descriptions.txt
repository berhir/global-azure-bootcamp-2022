AI for Good sign language detection research project
=============================================================================
We want to present a solution with which we can use AI to recognize sign language in online meetings in real time and translate it into text in a research project in our company.

The goal is to provide a tool that, as a first step, can translate sign language into subtitles in Microsoft Teams Meetings to include deaf people in meetings. For this we use a normal webcam, many processes and libraries and of course Azure Tools and Azure Machine Learning. The signs have to be shown, processed and normalized in order to train an ML model with them. Furthermore, the recognition must be able to distinguish between individual signs in order to then recognize individual signs. Since sign language does not contain complete sentences, a sentence must be formed from the individual words with AI. We had to find out and solve all these challenges in a research project. In this session we will show our current state of research and how the implementation with cloud computing in Microsoft Azure can work.

A Game of Hierarchies ‚Äì Hierarchies and Graphs in Power BI
=============================================================================
Hierarchies (and graphs) are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:

Product Categories
Sales Territories
Calendar and Time
Paths on a map
In Power BI Desktop you can transform such data into useful information via several approaches: standard & custom visuals, hierarchy slicers, hierarchies in the data model, parent-child hierarchies, etc.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies (and graphs) into useful reports. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin‚Äôs famous ‚ÄúA Game of Thrones‚Äù.

Single-Handed Sailing with Azure Red Hat OpenShift: Navigating the Managed Kubernetes Platform
=============================================================================
Join Markus Pleil, and Philipp Bergsmann, as they embark on an insightful journey comparing the challenges of single-handed sailing with the efficient management of the Azure Red Hat OpenShift service. In this session, they will delve into two key aspects of managing a Kubernetes platform.

Initially, the session will focus on the team structure and tasks required in a traditional self-managed on-premises environment. Markus and Philipp will shed light on the complexities and responsibilities involved in setting up such a system.
In the second part, the speakers will demonstrate how managed services can simplify the process, eliminating the need for certain tasks and enabling a single-handed approach to operating the Kubernetes platform. Drawing parallels to sailing, they will highlight how using managed services like Azure Red Hat OpenShift can streamline operations and increase efficiency.
This session will provide valuable insights for IT professionals and developers interested in exploring the potential of managed Kubernetes platforms and discovering how they can optimize their workflow with Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

Fast feedback with pull request deployments
=============================================================================
A modern DevOps process would no longer be possible without feature branches and pull request workflows. How are the changes of a pull request verified? Often, only a deployment into an isolated PR environment provides clarity. This allows testing in the overall context with surrounding systems and real data persistence, the deployment and upgrade process can be tested as well and last but not least a product owner can look at the change on a running system.

This talk will show everything that is needed for a pull request deployment and also show approaches for challenges like database schema deployment with data initialization as well as regression testing. The examples will be presented using Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Services.

OpenTelemetry for GitOps: Tracing Deployments from Git Commit to Production on AKS
=============================================================================
Neither GitOps (with tools such as ArgoCD or Flux) nor K8s provides a standard in tracing, orchestrating and troubleshooting the lifecycle of complex application deployments. There is no standard to define what "an application" is and there is no standard for lifecycle hooks that would enable easy pre-deployment dependency checks or post deployment health checks on application level.

The CNCF project Keptn addresses those challenges by extending the Kubernetes Pod scheduler to provide OpenTelemetry Traces and Prometheus metrics for end-2-end deployment observability. Keptn introduces automated application-aware pre- and post-deployment lifecycle hooks to enforce dependency checks, send notifications or evaluates SLOs that otherwise need a custom K8s operator. As a side benefit you get automatic DORA metrics to measure the success of your DevOps automation.
Join this talk and learn how the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit (KLT) Operator extends observability into GitOps deployments and how it enables declarative deployment lifecycle orchestration!

Beyond Logs: The power of observability with OpenTelemetry for your .NET applications
=============================================================================
Software development has changed a lot over time, becoming more complex by the day with a myriad of frameworks and tools to pick, globally distributed applications and the need for speed and reliability. This complexity makes troubleshooting issues in modern, cloud-native environments a real challenge. The common approach of: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs add a few log lines here and there and wait for the problem to happen again‚Äù does not scale.

While logs are a widespread and powerful tool for troubleshooting, they often lack context and only show part of the problem. Observability and OpenTelemetry are all about providing this missing context. They help you understand and confidently answer questions about the state of your applications.
In this talk, we'll explore the relationship between Observability and OpenTelemetry and how they can be leveraged in your .NET applications to align with modern observability practices
