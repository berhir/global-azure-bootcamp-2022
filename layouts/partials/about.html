                    Global Azure Austria brings together people from all over Austria and beyond. Therefore,
                    we decided to use <a href="https://www.gather.town/" target="_blank">gather.town</a> as our virtual
                    conference platform. This way, we can meet and talk to each other in a virtual room.
                    Everybody is welcome to join us, independent of where you live!

                    At Global Azure Austria, all sessions including demos will be performed live.

                <p class="text-faded">
                    In order to offer content
                    for a broad audience, we have sessions delivered in German and sessions in English so
                    that people who do not understand German fluently can participate in the event, too.
